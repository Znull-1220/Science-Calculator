## Instructions

### Calculation Mode
The formats for integration, differentiation, summation, and multiplication are:

$∫(expression, x, from, to)$

$der(expression, x, point)$

$∑(x, from, to, function)$

$∏(x, from, to, function)$

1. function/expression needs to be replaced with the function or expression you want to calculate.

2. from & to are the starting and ending points - integration limits for integral calculation, and upper/lower bounds for summation & multiplication.

3. point in differentiation formula represents the point at which the derivative is evaluated.

In all four formulas above, $x$ represents the variable.

### Equation Solving Mode

Simply input coefficients according to the format, separated by commas.

### Base Conversion Mode

The four buttons BIN, OCT, DEC, HEX in the "Base Conversion" section are only used in base conversion mode.

1. Initially in decimal base. To change the initial base, first press the base button for conversion, then input numbers.

2. After clicking the '=' button, the current number's base is confirmed as shown on screen. Then clicking the four buttons will convert to respective bases.

### Function Plotting Mode

The interface initially shows $f(x)=$. Only input the expression after the function. Click '=' button to display the graph window.

## Implementation
The code uses two jar packages: mXparser package and FlatLaf package.
